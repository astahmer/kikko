# Intro

Trong ORM allows you to run reactive SQLite queries on any platforms with any framework/lib. For the web apps it uses [absurd-sql](https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql), for electron/react-native/ionic — native sqlite calls(WIP). It supports React, Vue(WIP), Angular(WIP). It is actually framework/lib-agnostic, so you can integrate it to any framework/render libs you want.

## Core features

- Lib or framework agnostic — use with React, Angular, Vue or write adapter for your own lib
- Run on any platform — web, mobile(react-native/expo, cordova/ionic), desktop(electron, tauri)
- Full typescript support
- Out-of-the-box [query builder](/building-sql/query-builder). We tried to add support of all possible SQLite queries could be. But you can still use [raw SQL queries](/building-sql/raw).
- It is very modular. You can use `@trong-orm/sql`/`@trong-orm/query-builder`/`@trong-orm/core` without need to require the full lib. Use the only package you need
- Multi-tab support for web. Mutate DB in one tab, and your data will be updated in other
- [Plugin system](/plugins/creating-your-own) allows you to integrate your own code on query/transaction run

## It's better than IndexedDB

Read performance: doing something like `SELECT SUM(value) FROM kv`:

/>

Write performance: doing a bulk insert:

/>

The graphs are taken from [absurd-sql](https://github.com/jlongster/absurd-sql) repo.

Overall, it works more consistent than IndexedDB. It is very often the case when IndexedDB crashes, but due to absurd-sql makes simple blocks read and writes, SQLite works more consistently.
