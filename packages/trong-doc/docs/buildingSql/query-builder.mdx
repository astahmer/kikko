# Query builder

All we know that it is often thing that query builders are sucks. Usually it happens cause they need to support all SQL dialects, which are a lot.
But, with just one dialect, we managed to make builder that will be flexible enough, and will support all of the possilbe SQLite queries.

And if query builder functionality is not enough you could always use [raw queries](raw) and even embed them into query builder. When you use
raw builder your queries still remain reactive (but you need to mark tables you use with `sql.table('tableName')`).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @trong-orm/query-builder --save
```

Or

```bash
yarn add @trong-orm/query-builder
```
