# Listen queries

You must use [`react-queries-plugin`](/plugins/reactive-queries) to be able to listen queries.

Here is how you can listen changes in DB tables:

```typescript
const notesTable = sql.table("notes");

subscribeToQueries(db, [select().from(notesTable)]).subscribe((res) => {
  console.log("Queries result: ", res);
});
```
