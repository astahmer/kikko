# Deploying to Netlify

Here is the `netlify.toml` file that you need to put in the root of the repo.
It puts headers in the server responses to support absurd-sql SQL backend.

```toml
# The following redirect is intended for use with most SPAs that handle
# routing internally.
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy = "same-origin"
    Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy = "require-corp"
```
